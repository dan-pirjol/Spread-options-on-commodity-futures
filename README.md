# Spread-options-on-commodity-futures
A tutorial from CME Group on [spread options on futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/option-strategies/option-calendar-spreads.html) and their practical use.
These options are traded on many commodity futures: 

* crude oil
* [natural gas](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/introduction-to-energy/introduction-to-natural-gas/natural-gas-calendar-spread-options.html)
* [agricultural commodities](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/lessons/understanding-agricultural-calendar-spread-options.html)

There are two types of spread options:

* Options on the spread between two different assets. For example [WTI-Brent spread options](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/crude-oil/wti-brent-ice-bullet-swap-futures.quotes.html)

* Calendar spread options: these are options on the spread between futures on the same asset with different maturities

The project will study the pricing of these options, and their connection to the properties of the underlying futures. 

Data on spread options on futures is available from CME Group through the [Option Settlement Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/option-settlement.html)
